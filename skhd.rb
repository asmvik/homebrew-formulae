  def caveats; <<~EOS
    Copy the example configuration into your home directory:
      cp #{opt_pkgshare}/examples/skhdrc ~/.skhdrc

    If you want skhd to be managed by launchd (start automatically upon login):
      skhd --start-service

    When running as a launchd service logs will be found in:
      /tmp/skhd_<user>.[out|err].log

  test do
    assert_match "skhd-v#{version}", shell_output("#{bin}/skhd --version")
  end
